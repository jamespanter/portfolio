        <p>
          Bristol based developer, currently training on an intensive front-end
          software development course in Bristol â€“ from January to April 2020.
          Following the course, I am keen to continue my learning of other
          coding languages as well as further my expertise in the areas I have
          learnt already. During this course, I have learnt to use:
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};
